# Earthquake Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of earthquake data, focusing on identifying trends, severity, impact, and geographic distribution of earthquakes over a defined period. The interactive visualizations are designed to help stakeholders make informed decisions regarding disaster preparedness, resource allocation, and response strategies.

## Key Features

### 1. Temporal Analysis
- **Total Earthquakes by Year**: Visualizes yearly trends in earthquake frequency, highlighting periods of increased activity.
- **Total Earthquakes by Month**: Provides a monthly breakdown to identify seasonal patterns in seismic activity.

### 2. Severity and Impact
- **Total Earthquakes by Magnitude**: Categorizes earthquakes into `Strong`, `Moderate`, and `Minor` based on magnitude.
- **Total Deaths by Year**: Shows the human impact of earthquakes by analyzing yearly casualties.

### 3. Financial Impact
- **Total Amount Spent Each Year in Dollars**: Highlights annual earthquake-related spending, identifying years with higher recovery and response costs.

### 4. Geographic Distribution
- **Total Earthquakes by Place (Map)**: Maps earthquake occurrences to identify high-risk regions and areas requiring focused attention.

## Insights
The dashboard provides the following actionable insights:
1. **Temporal Trends**: Identifies peak years and potential seasonal patterns in earthquake occurrences.
2. **Severity Correlation**: Demonstrates how stronger earthquakes correlate with higher human and financial impacts.
3. **Spending Trends**: Highlights resource-intensive years, helping guide budget planning for disaster management.
4. **Regional Risks**: Pinpoints high-activity seismic zones, supporting targeted mitigation strategies.
